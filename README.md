# Welcome to GuaraProductions!

Hi!

My name is Gustavo Lopes, the founder of GuaraProductions, and welcome to my group!

As stated in the group's description, the purpose of 'GuaraProductions' is to publish games and related technologies,
made by... you guessed it, me :P

Yes, this is a 'one man company' so to speak. I don't actually plan on hiring, or inviting other people to this group,
because the projects here are meant to be my personal collection of things that I worked and that is related to videogames.

Since I was a kid, I loved videogames and always wanted to learn more about what it goes to making games, and if I would 
be able to publish a complete video game one day.

Right now, all of the projects you are currently seeing right now are prototypes, they are all imcomplete in some way
(probably even buggy), but I pretend in the near future, make some changes to this projects, in order to make them more 
polished.

I can't promise you this... since I have bigger and more ... let's just say.. ambitious projects on my mind.. but I 
should definitely start making some plans and organize the things that I want to acomplish here.

And... yeah, that's about it

Thanks for reading

:-)

Obs: Here is a list of my projects:
