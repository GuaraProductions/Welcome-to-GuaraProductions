# Welcome to GuaraProductions!

Hi!

My name is Gustavo Lopes, the founder of GuaraProductions, and welcome to my group!

As stated in the group's description, the purpose of 'GuaraProductions' is to publish games and related technologies,
made by... you guessed it, me :P

Yes, this is a 'one man company' so to speak. I don't actually plan on hiring, or inviting other people into to this group,
because the projects here are meant to be my personal collection of things that I worked and that is related to videogames.

Since I was a kid, I loved videogames and always wanted to learn more about what it goes to making games, and if I would 
be able to publish a full gaming experience someday.

Right now, all of the projects you are currently seeing are prototypes, they are all incomplete in some way
(probably even buggy), but I pretend in the near future, in the next 3 to 5 years, make a game of my own, and publish on 
Gamejolt(or even Steam... who knows).

I can't tell if this is going to be a success or not, but what I do know, is that I am going to make this dream a reality,
and hope I can one day share this to you. 

And... yeah, that's about it

Thanks for reading

:-)
